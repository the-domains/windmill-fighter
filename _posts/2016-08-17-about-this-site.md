# About this site...

Hi, my name is Matt: I think about too many things and I think about them all the time. This fancy site is a product from the folks over at http://thegrid.io - a website built by Skynet (AI) that contains my personal musings on everything from life and its eccentricities to entrepreneurship and small business to politics, religion, and everything else your mother told you wasn't polite conversation.

Enjoy at your own risk!
